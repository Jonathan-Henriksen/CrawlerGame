## Serilog Integration in The project

The project showcases the power and flexibility of **Serilog**, a premier logging library for .NET, to enhance both the developer's experience and the game's stability.

### Overview:
Serilog's structured logging approach ensures that logs are more than just data dumps. They become valuable insights that aid in debugging, monitoring, and understanding the game's flow.

### Features and Benefits:

- **Templating**: The project leverages Serilog's templating to make logs more informative. Instead of generic messages, logs are enriched with context, making them easier to understand and act upon.
  
- **Filtering**: The game directs logs to appropriate destinations based on their importance or category. This ensures that critical logs aren't buried under less important information, making troubleshooting more efficient.
  
- **Debugging and Monitoring**: With detailed logs, developers can gain a clearer picture of the game's operations, which aids in debugging and performance monitoring.

### Specific Implementation in The solution:

#### Used Sinks:
Logs are directed to both the console and files:
- **Console**: Provides real-time feedback, especially useful during development and debugging phases.
- **File**: Ensures there's a persistent record of logs, allowing for post-mortem analysis or historical reviews.

#### Expression Templates:
The solution employs Serilog's expression templates for concise and readable log messages. This feature ensures that logs are not just descriptive but also user-friendly. For instance, exceptions in the game are logged with detailed templates, transforming traditional log messages into more structured and informative ones.

#### Configuration:
The game offers flexibility in configuring Serilog. This includes setting log levels to determine the verbosity of logs, specifying file paths for persistent storage, and designing output templates to format logs in a desired manner. This configurability ensures that logging can be tailored to specific needs, whether it's during active development or in a production environment.

By integrating Serilog, The solution demonstrates how structured logging can significantly improve a project's maintainability and observability.
