## Cancellation Tokens in NeuralJourney

NeuralJourney employs Cancellation Tokens to enhance responsiveness and resource management, ensuring that operations can be monitored and, if necessary, canceled to maintain application responsiveness.

### Overview:
Cancellation Tokens in .NET provide a cooperative cancellation model, allowing tasks to be canceled in a non-abrupt manner. This ensures that resources are freed up and that the application remains responsive, especially during potentially long-running operations.

### Usage and Context:

#### Client-Server Communication:
- In the context of establishing a connection between the client and the server, Cancellation Tokens are used to set a timeout. If the connection isn't established within a specified time frame, the operation is gracefully canceled, ensuring the game doesn't hang or become unresponsive.
  
- The game handles scenarios where the connection attempt is canceled due to a timeout. In such cases, informative feedback is provided to the user, and necessary cleanup operations are performed.

#### Input Handling:
- Cancellation Tokens are also employed in input handlers, such as the Console Input Handler. This ensures that the game remains responsive while waiting for user input. If the user decides to close the connection or if there's an external request to cancel the operation, the input handling task is gracefully terminated.

### Benefits:
- **Graceful Handling**: Operations, especially those that might take longer durations, can be monitored and, if necessary, canceled. This ensures that the game remains responsive and doesn't hang.
  
- **Resource Efficiency**: By monitoring and potentially canceling long-running operations, the game ensures optimal resource utilization, leading to smoother gameplay.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Players aren't left waiting indefinitely. If an operation takes too long or if there's a need to cancel a task, the game provides immediate feedback, ensuring a seamless user experience.

By utilizing Cancellation Tokens, NeuralJourney prioritizes user experience, ensuring smooth gameplay without unnecessary delays or hang-ups.
