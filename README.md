# NeuralJourney

## Overview

NeuralJourney is a text-based game engine developed with a server/client architecture, facilitating multiplayer interactions within a shared virtual environment. The project integrates OpenAI to dynamically process and map player commands, creating a responsive and adaptive gameplay experience. With the integration of Serilog and Seq, detailed logging of events and interactions is achieved through structured and contextual logging, providing developers and sysadmins easy access to important application events. Beyond the technological integrations, the engine is built upon a foundation of best practices and design patterns, making it a robust and scalable solution.

This project is more than just lines of code; it's a story of passion, learning, and creativity. It's about the countless hours spent refining a feature, the moments of eureka, and the challenges overcome. As you delve into its various sections, I hope you experience a bit of the journey I undertook in creating it.

## Purpose

#### The Joy of Development
At its essence, the project is about the passion for coding. It offers a platform for others to reference, tinker with, or expand upon. It's a reflection of the joy and satisfaction derived from building a project from the ground up and witnessing its evolution.

#### Continuous Learning
The development of the game was a journey of continuous learning. Each feature, integration, and design decision was a step towards a deeper understanding of .NET development. From exploring the capabilities of external tools to mastering internal .NET functionalities, the project embodies the spirit of growth and exploration.

#### Showcasing Best Practices
While the project leverages tools like OpenAI and Serilog, its core strength lies in the implementation of best practices and design patterns. The project demonstrates the use of common patterns such as the Command, Factory, and Middleware patterns, among others. It's designed to be a reference for developers, illustrating how to effectively structure and organize code in a .NET project.
