## Reflection and Attributes in NeuralJourney

NeuralJourney employs Reflection and Attributes to dynamically generate a command registry, streamlining the process of matching player inputs with their corresponding commands.

### Overview:
Reflection in .NET allows for runtime introspection of assemblies, types, and members. Attributes provide a mechanism to add metadata to code elements. In NeuralJourney, these features are combined to create a dynamic command registry based on custom attributes associated with game commands.

### Usage and Context:

#### Command Registry Generation:
- NeuralJourney uses custom attributes to annotate game commands, defining their names/identifiers and types (e.g., admin or player commands).
  
- At startup, the game uses Reflection to scan for these attributes and generates a static command registry. This registry serves as a lookup table, mapping command identifiers to their respective game commands.

#### Dynamic Command Matching:
- When processing player inputs, especially those interpreted by OpenAI, NeuralJourney consults the command registry to find the matching game command based on the completion provided by OpenAI.
  
- This dynamic command matching ensures that player inputs are accurately mapped to their corresponding game actions, providing a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience.

### Benefits:
- **Dynamic Command Lookup**: By generating a command registry at startup, NeuralJourney ensures efficient and accurate matching of player inputs to game commands.
  
- **Modularity**: Using attributes to define command metadata promotes a modular design, allowing for easy addition or modification of game commands without altering the core command processing logic.
  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The dynamic command registry ensures that player inputs, as interpreted by OpenAI, are consistently and accurately mapped to in-game actions, leading to a responsive and intuitive gameplay experience.

By integrating Reflection and Attributes in this manner, NeuralJourney demonstrates an innovative approach to dynamic command processing, ensuring a fluid and adaptive gaming environment.
